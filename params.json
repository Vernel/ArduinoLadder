{"name":"Arduinoladder","tagline":"GUI application to create Arduino programs using ladder logic (like a PLC)","body":"![logic.png](http://beeond.net/landing/images/LadderLogic.png)\r\n\r\n### Arduino as a PLC.\r\nArduinoLadder is an open source project that allows users to develop Arduino sketches using a graphical ladder logic editor.\r\nThe software is developed using Mono, the multi-platform version of .NET. Therefore, it can be comiled to run on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.\r\nInitially a Windows installer will be provided for those users that do not want to deal with compilers and coding.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nArduinoLadder has been created as a GUI code generator that uses [Electronics&Micros' plcLib](http://www.electronics-micros.com/software-hardware/plclib-arduino/) libraries. The libraries implment high level functions to instantiate coils, contact, latches, timers, etc. connected by rungs as you would in a [ladder logic diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nWe are working on a detailed documentation and a video tutorial as we iprove the user experience. For now, to understand what you can do, you may refer to the plcLib documentation on [getting started with ladder logic](http://www.electronics-micros.com/software-hardware/plclib-arduino-ladder-logic/).\r\nAlso, you will find some raw documentation in the Documents folder of the project.\r\n\r\n### Donate to a good cause!\r\n![IDC](http://www.fondazionedecarneri.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PHC_logo.png)\r\n> This application and its source code are free for you to use, but please consider donating something. The funds received through your donations will be used to support the [Ivo de Carneri Foundation](http://www.fondazionedecarneri.it/en/),  a very active charity organization who promotes the fight against infectious and parasitic diseases in developing countries, supports research and education work for the socio-economic factors which are essential to the health and progress of those communities.
